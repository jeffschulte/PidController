# PidController

To build, run "source build.sh" on command line.
To run, run "./build/src/pidProject" from root dir on the command line

Unfortunately I didn't make it across the finish line. I got the tempurature reading and wrote the PID code, 
but I got stuck on trying to get the LabJack to properly control the duty cycle. Really I'm just unable to 
read from the device successfully. I've left my attempts in the pidProjectLib.cpp code.
