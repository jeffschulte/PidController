# PidController

To build, run "source build.sh" from root dir.

To run, run "./build/src/pidProject" from root dir.

Unfortunately I didn't make it across the finish line. I got the tempurature reading successfully and wrote the PID code, 
but I got stuck on trying to get the LabJack to properly control the duty cycle. Really I'm just unable to 
read from the device successfully. I've left my attempts in the pidProjectLib.cpp file.
